# linear data structure made up of nodes and refs to the next node

# lets make some node class


# now lets think of how we can make nodes interact in a way that consolidates their pieces together

# lets make a LinkedList class
# think of the idea of having a head and a tail like a snake 
# where the snake can grow based upon having more links in it
