# lets think of another scenareo where we want to model a line at a store
#  or a queue at the airport

# for this comes the queue data structure
# like the stack we can add and remove data
# this is more like a line of people in a queue

# for this we could enqueue and item on to the data structure
# and we can dequeue an item from the queue

# This data structure works as a FIFO or (first in first out) data structure

# think of how you could utilise a linked list to create a queue
